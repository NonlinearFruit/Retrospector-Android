# Retrospector
This is an Android reference tool for [Retrospector][retro]; intended for looking up your ratings on-the-go. As of version `0.1` there is no way to sync the desktop and android databases. However there is some fake data to play with.


## Features
Here are some of the cool features contained in this app (as of version `0.1`). 

### Main Screen
The main screen is a list of all media. It is used to lookup a particular media.

To that end, it contains a search box that will fuzzy search the media. This search is identical to the one in the [desktop version][retro].
