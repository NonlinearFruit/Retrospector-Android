# Retrospector
This is an Android reference tool for [Retrospector][retro]; intended for looking up your ratings on-the-go. Syncing with the desktop is now easy as pi (see Syncing); so your entire database of movie reviews goes everywhere you do!


## Features
Here are some of the cool features contained in this app (as of version `0.3`). 

### Syncing

### Main Screen
The main screen is a list of all media. It is used to lookup a particular media.

To that end, it contains a search box that will fuzzy search the media. This search is identical to the one in the [desktop version][retro].
